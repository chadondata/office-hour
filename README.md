# office-hour

This bit of software is designed to be a scheduling app for my students to schedule office hours without having to spend needless hours with back and forth emails, Slack messages, and such.

## Goals

- I can login and access an admin page where I can add time blocks
- A student can visit the schedule offic hours page and select from an available block of time
- The software will collect the following elements from the student
  - Their full name
  - The course/section in which they're enrolled
  - Their email address
  - A brief description of what they'd like to discuss.
- The software will email both me and the student a confirmation

### Stretch Targets

- The software will create a Zoom meeting and send invite details to both the instructor and the student.
